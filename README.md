## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores genome-wide association data from the **GWAS Catalog** to identify genes significantly associated with human traits and diseases. Conducted using Python and R, this analysis focuses on frequency calculations, gene–trait associations, SNP mapping, population bias identification, odds ratios, and data visualization.
